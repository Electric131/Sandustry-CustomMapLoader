# Sandustry Custom Map Loader (CML)

Sandustry Custom Map Loader (CML) is a mod that allows the easy creation and selection of custom maps for [Sandustry](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2764460/Sandustry/) using the [Sandustry Modloader](https://git.rendezvous.dev/shadowcomputer/sandustry-modloader).

The installation process has been simplified since v2 of the modloader (now renamed to Fluxloader), and all you have to do is search for the map loader in the Fluxloader UI. You can do the same process for the maps you want to play with.

Once you install the mod for the map you want, the main menu "Select Map" drop down should allow you to select the map upon restarting the game.

**If you have an issue and are unable to choose the map in game (e.g. it crashes on startup), you can change the map through the mod config in the Fluxloader app**

You can find more information about this mod at https://github.com/Electric131/Sandustry-CustomMapLoader.

## Making a Map

To learn more about making a map as well as what each file in a map does, check out [the wiki](https://github.com/Electric131/Sandustry-CustomMapLoader/wiki/Making-a-Map).

Note: Make sure your mod has the `map` tag in order for the map loader to pick it up as a map.
