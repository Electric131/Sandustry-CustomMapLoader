# Sandustry Custom Map Loader (CML)

Sandustry Custom Map Loader (CML) is a mod that allows the easy creation and selection of custom maps for [Sandustry](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2764460/Sandustry/) using the [Sandustry Modloader](https://git.rendezvous.dev/shadowcomputer/sandustry-modloader).

## Installation

**_Note: The Sandustry Modloader must be installed beforehand_**

To install the custom map loader, locate the `mods` folder created by the Sandustry Modloader. Once you find this folder, download [custommaploader.js](https://github.com/Electric131/Sandustry-CustomMapLoader/releases/latest/download/custommaploader.js) and put it into that folder.

After running the game with the mod for the first time, you should see a dropdown in the main menu as well as a `maps` folder located inside the `mods` folder.

Now you'll want to find a zipped map file (or try [this example map](https://github.com/Electric131/Sandustry-CustomMapLoader/releases/latest/download/flat.zip)) and unzip/extract the contents into their own folder.

Place the unzipped/extracted folder into the `maps` folder from earlier (Do not place the _contents_ of the folder into the maps folder). _Note: The name of this folder will be the name of the map as seen in game_

Check the example below to see the proper installation of an example map named `examplemap`:

!['examplemap' folder located inside the maps folder](/imgs/maps_folder.png)

Once the map is placed inside the `maps` folder, the main menu "Select Map" drop down should allow you to select the map upon restarting the game.

If you installed the map correctly, you should now be able to load a save with the custom map.
